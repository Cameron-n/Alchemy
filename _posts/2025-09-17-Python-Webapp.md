## Introduction

**Note: The associated repo can be found [here](https://github.com/Cameron-n/Morrowind-Alchemy).**

During the first year of my software apprenticeship, I heavily used a Python library called Dash to create a dashboard for the company. As I used the library more, and learnt surrounding skills and technologies, I realised that, despite it's name, it can be used to create whole webapps, not just dashboards.

In my previous project, I wanted to showcase my skills yet also enjoy myself. That's why I focused on data from one of my favourite games, Morrowind. My technical skills have improved since that project (almost two years ago!), and I'm still in love with the world of Morrowind.

So, this project will be about building a webapp to showcase my new skills and vastly improve on that past project.
